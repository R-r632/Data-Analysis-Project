  2. Loan Status Prediction
  3. Oscar Awards Analysis

1. Credit Card Customer & Transaction PowerBI Dashboard Report
   Refrenced From Web Sources
    - Applied Skills:
                      :: Technical Tools-Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerBI, PostgreSQL
                      :: Course Skills-Database Management System, Data Analytics
                      :: Consulting Skills- Problem Solving, Analytical Skills
    - CSV Files downloaded from WebSources
    - Data Cleaned With The Help Of MS-EXCEL and PostgreSQL
    - Created Dashboard On PowerBI And Exported in PDF Format.

2. Loan Status Prediction
   Refrenced From Web Sources
    - Applied Skills:
                      :: Technical Tools-Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerBI, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook, Python
                      :: Python Libraries: NumPy(Mathematical Operation), Pandas(CSV Formatting & Data Cleaning), Matplotlib & Seaborn(Data Visualization), Sklearn (Machine Learning Prediction), Joblib(GUI)
                      :: Course Skills-Python Language, Machine Learning, Database Management System, Data Analytics
                      :: Consulting Skills- Problem Solving, Analytical Skills
    - CSV Files downloaded from WebSources
    - Data Cleaned With The Help Of MS-EXCEL and PostgreSQL
    - Created Dashboard On PowerBI And Exported in PDF Format.
    - With The Help of Pandas, Imported CSV Files & Data Transformed
    - NumPy to perform Mathematical Operation inside JupyNB
    - Created Dummy Variables As Machine Only Understand 0 And 1 value.
    - Then Use Machine Learning Libraries To Perform Prediction by done some certain mathematical operation and library prediction with help of train and test some datas and exported to csv.
    - With The Help Of Train & Test CSV Datasets, Machine Prediction Performed.
    - Experimental Prediction Inside JupyNB is performed by taking some data examples.
    - With the above Exp. Prediction, Machine is trained
    - Import Pickle, to export the trained prediction to model.
    - By Joblib import the trained model and create a GUI Interface.
    - From GUI Interface, Now Loan Prediction is created based on data we store.

                       :: Consulting Skills- Problem Solving, Analytical Skills
     - CSV Files downloaded from Oscars.org
     - Data Collected And Transfered With The Help Of PostgreSQL
     - Data Modified With The Help Of MS-Excel
     - Data Visualization In Python With The help Of Matplotlib And Seaborn
     - Created Dashboard On PowerBI And Exported in PDF Format.
